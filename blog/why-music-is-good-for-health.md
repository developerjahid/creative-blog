  Music, art concerned with combining vocal or instrumental sounds for beauty of
  form or emotional expression, usually according to cultural standards of
  rhythm, melody, and, in most Western music, harmony. Both the simple folk song
  and the complex electronic composition belong to the same activity, music.
  Both are humanly engineered; both are conceptual and auditory, and these
  factors have been present in music of all styles and in all periods of
  history, throughout the world.

# No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You hit me with a cricket bat.

You've swallowed a planet! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on!**Kill me!\***KILL ME!\*Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

## Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

1. \*Insistently\* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
2. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
3. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
