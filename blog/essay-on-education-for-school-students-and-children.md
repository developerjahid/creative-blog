  Education is an important tool which is very useful in everybody’s life.
  Education is what differentiates us from other living beings on earth. It
  makes man the smartest creature on earth. It empowers humans and gets them
  ready to face challenges of life efficiently. With that being said, education
  still remains a luxury and not a necessity in our country. Educational
  awareness needs to be spread through the country to make education accessible.
  But, this remains incomplete without first analyzing the importance of
  education. Only when the people realize what significance it holds, can they
  consider it a necessity for a good life. In this essay on Education, we will
  see the importance of education and how it is a doorway to success.

# No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! You hit me with a cricket bat. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? You hit me with a cricket bat.

You've swallowed a planet! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on!**Kill me!***KILL ME!*Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

## Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

1. \*Insistently\* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
2. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
3. Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.
