# No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

You've swallowed a planet! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on!**Kill me!***KILL ME!*Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

2. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.
